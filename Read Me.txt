If you are using the Prompt for Text Etal using the Selective Itemiser 5 flag,
put the CustomLanguage.def file in C:\ICRTouch\skin\

It will overwrite all current references to Selective Itemiser 5 and replace them with

"Do not set to YES" though out the system, and replace the Selective Itemiser 5 flag
in PLU porogramming to "Prompt for Text"
